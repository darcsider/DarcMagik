Development Journal Day 1
October 22nd, 2018

A couple of days ago I started working on this project again after several months, I am working on turning this project into 
a full fledged video game that I will use as part of my portfolio to show to potential employers.  The goal of this project
is to make a fully functional old school 2D top down RPG but also to showcase my abilities to build a game engine.  The engine
backend to this project was built with the plans to be cross platform with modules for various platforms built and added to the
project.

The goal for this week is to begin to figure out the next stages of the game, I need to get a character on screen and moving around,
I need to get that characters movement to affect moving the world around it / make the view of the world move as they near the edge
of what is visible to the player.  Then I also need to get the collission map working correctly and stuff like that I think that
will be my goal for the project and then I can move on from there to other tasks.

Development Journa Day 2
October 25th, 2018

I started working on User Interface stuff today trying to figure out how to make a message box that can easily change size, I worked
on it for quite a while before I realized that making it able to grow to any size was majorly challenging because what works for some
sizes doesn't work for other sizes.  I made the decision that I'm going to simply use a specific sized message / dialog box for the
game but will include code for being able to have text scrolling in the box and an image for the character in the box.  But the work
that I did for trying to grow a message box will be used for building things like an options screen, items screen and party screen
through the use of panals.  I also figured out how to create a gradient effect with those panals.
